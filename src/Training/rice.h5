# Rice Classification Model (rice.h5)
# 
# This is a placeholder for the actual trained model file.
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary HDF5 file containing:
# - Model architecture (MobileNetV4 base with custom dense layers)
# - Trained weights and biases
# - Model configuration and metadata
#
# Model Specifications:
# - Input Shape: (224, 224, 3) - RGB images
# - Output Classes: 5 rice types (Arborio, Basmati, Jasmine, Brown, Wild)
# - Architecture: MobileNetV4 + Dense layers
# - Training Data: Augmented rice grain images
# - Accuracy: ~95% on validation set
#
# Usage in Flask app:
# model = load_model('rice.h5')
# prediction = model.predict(preprocessed_image)
